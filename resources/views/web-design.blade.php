		<p class="sharubati-text">The Web is big and is only going to get bigger; becoming more and more a part of our daily lives, both personal and professional. There is no doubt that no matter the industry, any business should almost assuredly be on the web.

			But for us the question really is what the business needs out of their website, and what goals they have for their web presence. Then we build websites to cater to those goals. We provide custom design that is responsive ready, content management suited to your needs, shopping cart, social media & email integration, support and upgrade.

			We believe in the mobile first approach, and the numbers estimate about 70% of all web traffic to come from mobile devices. So we make sure your website looks good on mobile before it looks good on other devices.</p>

				 	We invest in time to understand your business and the industry macros which provides us with the insight and ability to make recommendations that will deliver measurable results. Then we map out specific objectives, clear, understandable metrics that we can start to affect real, measurable change and ROI. We involve the business stakeholders to get their business and operational requirements from the website.
					Then we set out to understand your audienceâ€™s specific needs & expectations. Once we understand who the audience is, we map out user journey, identifying critical tasks that users will need to make, and the ease with which they should access action triggers.

				 <h3 class="web-services-subtitle sharubati-subtitle" >2. UI/UX Design</h3>
				 <p class="sharubati-text web-services-text">
				 	The design process starts with understanding how the user will interact with the elements on their screen: content, navigation, calls to action, interactive features etc. Then creating wireframe sketches that become the blueprint for designers, developers and SEO teams to understand what a specific page needs to do.
					One thing we ensure is that your corporate brand  transitions seamlessly and thrives in the digital realm as it would in print. This is where the art of our designers come in play as they explore how a brand might look and feel when experienced in a digital environment and how elements should adapt to changing screen sizes.

				 <p class="sharubati-text web-services-text">
				 	If content is the fuel of the web, then code and development is surely the engine that drives it. We build the technology that powers your website, a robust and secure CMS that is flexible but packs a myriad of  useful functions such as e-commerce, email and social media integration, blogging, analytics and much more. 
					Our development is user oriented and is aimed towards a seamless, pain-free user experience.  A strategy that enhances how a visitor interacts with a site, how forms appear, unique and identical buttons with subtle animations, pages update without having to totally reload, subtle feedback on actions.

				 <p class="sharubati-text web-services-text">
				 	But what is a website without traffic. We dont just build an impressive site and leave it there, we also  help you run succesiful campaigns to build regular traffic. Often, we shall make a few tweaks and upgrades where necessary. We encourage our clients to allow us to support their websites because over time, we get deep insights from the data that is running through the system, which informs our recommendation.
					When you need to add a function to your site that had not been apparent earlier, its always easier for us to integrate it since we understand the code. Further, we use a distributed VCS, which allows us to work on  issues without taking your site offline.
