				<h1 class="sharubati-title blue">Content Marketing</h1>
				<p class="sharubati-text">They say content is king. We say presentation is queen. The world is getting noisier by the day and competition for attention even stiffer. Presenting the right information when a customer is looking for it could be a better way to sell to them as well. Content helps provide answers to prospective customers. Informative content like blogs and infographics, whitepapers, eBooks, email newsletters, how-to guides and product videos are doing wonders for brands awareness.</br></br>
					The catch is, it has to be quality content. The right content makes you memorable. And thats why we utilise good story telling to create engaging content that your customers will not only appreciate but will be compelled to share. We anticipate your likely customers questions and create attention grabbing content that is targeted, resonates with your audience and builds trust in your brand.
					Here’s reasons why you should consider content marketing as a strategy:</br></br>
					<ul class="sharubati-text">
						<li><b>Lift Brand Awareness.</b> A content driven strategy can help reach a massive new audience.</li>
						<li><b>Generate Leads.</b> An increased regular traffic means more leads. Coupled with sign-up forms or downloads can help yield more sales.</li>
						<li><b>Boost Communication.</b> Consistent communication to your customers in a very noisy digital world makes you their trusted source of information and by extension the products.</li>
					</ul>
